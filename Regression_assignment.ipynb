    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it\n",
    "represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. R-squared (coefficient of determination) measures how well a linear regression model explains the variability of the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means the model explains none of the variability, and 1 means it explains all of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - (SS(res)/SS(tot))\n",
    "\n",
    "SS(res): Sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.\n",
    "SS(tot): Sum of squared differences between observed values and their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it Represents:\n",

    "Goodness of Fit: Higher R-squared indicates a better fit.\n",

    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Adjusted R-squared is a version of R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors in a model. Unlike regular R-squared, which always increases with more predictors, adjusted R-squared increases only if the new predictor genuinely improves the model's fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Difference:\n",

    "- Regular R-squared: Measures fit but can be misleading with many predictors.\n",

    "Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when you have a multiple regression model with several predictors. It is particularly useful in the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Selection: When comparing models with a different number of predictors, adjusted R-squared helps determine which model has a better fit without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoiding Overfitting: In models with many predictors, adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of irrelevant variables, providing a more realistic assessment of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex Models: When building a model with a large dataset or when you're experimenting with adding/removing variables, adjusted R-squared gives a more accurate indication of the model's effectiveness."

    "Advantages:\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",

    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpretable Units: RMSE is in the same units as the original data, making it easier to understand and interpret.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Non-Linear Relationships: They struggle with capturing complex non-linear relationships.\n",
